## Programming Assignment in Getting and Cleaning Data 

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

*  `Download the all the dataset `
*  `Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation`
*  `Adds Training or Test identifier on each data sets.`
*  `Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset`
*  `Converts the activity and subject columns into factors`
*  `Merges the two datasets`
*  `Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.`
*  `The result file is a tidy data set called tidyDataSet.txt`
