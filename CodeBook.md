# Code Book

Codebook that describves the variables in the resulting data set called `tidyDataSet.txt`.

## Factors

* `Subject` - ID of the test/train subjects
* `Activity` - Type of activity performed by the subjects when measurment was done
* `Test or Train` - Type of the trials done

## Measurements
The measured parameters or variable names (features) are modified to become more readable and descriptive resulting to the following variables:

*  `BodyAcc mean X`
*  `BodyAcc mean Y`
*  `BodyAcc mean Z`
*  `BodyAcc std X`
*  `BodyAcc std Y`
*  `BodyAcc std Z`
*  `GravityAcc mean X`
*  `GravityAcc mean Y`
*  `GravityAcc mean Z`
*  `GravityAcc std X`
*  `GravityAcc std Y`
*  `GravityAcc std Z`

## Activity Labels
The following are activity where variables are measured, having the initial respective codes as "1", "2", "3", "4" and "5"

* `WALKING`: subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` : subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` : subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` : subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` : subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` : subject was laying down during the test
